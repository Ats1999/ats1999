If i do promotion by ads or any other means, youtube or udemy won't let me succeed.

### Do it like this

I have some companies

I'll tell my employes to work on those technologies and make a blog and video about those technologies.
Then upload the blogs and videos to the platform.

Encourage the new comers to  watch the videos and tell him that it's a great video


Also, set price for comments if user wish to  view, 

set different price for live sessions included QnA
